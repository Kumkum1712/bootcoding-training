    <h3>BLOCKQUOTE TAG</h3>
    <P><blockquote>HTML BLOCKQUOTE </blockquote>tag makes long quotes look special. It gives them a different style to stand out and look better. It lets you use different things like headings or lists inside the quote. This helps you organize and make your quotes more interesting for people reading your webpage.

    <blockquote>Note: </blockquote> BLOCKQUOTE tag in HTML5 specifies the section quoted from other sources, unlike HTML4.1, which defines long quotations that span multiple lines.</P>
