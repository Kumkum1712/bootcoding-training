    <h1>NEWLY ADDED ELEMENTS IN HTML5</h1>
    <P><U><em>Audio and Video: </em></U>HTML5 has two key additions: audio and video tags. It enables website developers to insert video or music into their pages.</P>
    <p><u><em>Vector Graphics: </em></u>This is a new feature in the updated version that has had a significant impact on the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It may be used to create visuals using a variety of shapes and colors using scripting, most commonly JS.</p> 
    <p><u><em>Header and Footer: </em></u>There is no need to use a div> tag to separate the two elements with these new tags. The footer appears at the bottom of the page, while the header appears at the top. The browser will know what to load first and what to load later if you use the HTML5 elements header and footer.</p>
    <p><u><em>Progress tag: </em></u>The progress tag is used to check the progress of a task during the execution. Progress tag can be used with the conjunction of JavaScript.</p>
    <p><u><em>Placeholder Attribute: </em></u>The placeholder attribute offers a brief description of an input field’s/text area’s intended value. Before the user inputs a value, a small hint appears in the field.</p>
    <p><u><em>Email attribute: </em></u>When the form’s input type is set to email, the browser receives instructions from the code to write an email in a valid format. The format of the input email id is automatically verified to ensure that it is correct.</p>   
    <p><u><em>Storage: </em></u>In HTML, we can utilize the browser as temporary storage, however in HTML5, we use an application cache, a web SQL database, and web storage.</p>
